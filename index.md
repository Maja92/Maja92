Hello I'm a Electrical Engineering major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2, part 1 was my favorite because it was the first lab that we applied what we learned in lecture to an actual project. I also liked how simple but challenging it was to do at the time without any prior experience in coding.

Lab 7, part 1 was another of my favorite labs because it challenged our thinking. Specifically the parts where we had to figure out how to write the scheduled hours for parking. 

Lab 10, part 1 this lab was also one of my favorites because we used loops. It was satisfying seeing the code run correctly and through the necessary tests.
